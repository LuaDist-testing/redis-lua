v1.0.1 (2010-xx-xx)
  * Providing a more generalized version of the multibulk request serializer.

  * _G is now passed as the argument of a pipeline block. This will change in 
    a future major release of redis-lua, but for now it is useful to enable 
    the usage of global functions inside of a pipeline block.

  * Fix: user-added commands were not available when pipelining commands.

v1.0.0 (2010-06-02)
  * First versioned release of redis-lua
